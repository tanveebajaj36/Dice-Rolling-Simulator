# Dice-Rolling-Simulator
As the name of the program suggests, we will be imitating a rolling dice. This will generate a random number each dice the program runs, and the users can use the dice repeatedly for as long as he/she wants. When the user rolls the dice, the program will generate a random number between 1 and 6.
